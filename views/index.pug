    h2 Individual assignments
    p.
      During the couse there will be 5 individual assignments that you will be required to hand in. To hand in an
      assignment you simply send all the required files (will be outlined in the description of the assignment) to me
      at #[a(href="mailto:alexandra.hou@gmail.com") alexandra.hou@gmail.com]. Remember to put your full name in the
      mail, since theese assignments will be a part of your final grade.
    p.
      The last hour of each day will focus on these assignments and give you time in class to work, remember this is
      also an opportunity to ask questions while working on the assignment.
  section(class="column small-12")
    h2 Group project
    p.
      You must form groups of 3-4 people (there will be time for this on the first day). The project is very open, the
      only requirement is that you combine more than one media into a multimedia project.
    p.
      You will have to make a written description of your project and send to me no later than 10/8-16 12.00 (noon)
      You will also have to present your project to the rest of the class on the 11/8-16.
    p.
      Monday through wednesday of the last week is devoted to making this project. During those days you will work full
      time on your project, my main function will be to answer any question that arises in the process. Since 3 days is
      not a lot of time, I suggest that you during the course discuss ideas in your group, so that when you start
      working on your project, you allready have a vision of the project.
