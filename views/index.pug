    h2 Prerequisites
    p.
      In order to complete the mandatory assignments during the course you will need to bring your own computer. You
      will also have to install all the software listed below in the software section. I expect you all to have
      downloaded and installed this prior to the first class on monday.
    p.
      You will also need devices for capturing images and film, a phone will do, but of course a good camera would be
      more fun. You will need a tripod (or other device to hold your camera in position) for making stop motion, but
      only one pr group is necessary, so if you have it bring it, and I will try to make sure there is one in every
      group.

    h2 About the course
    p.
      The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to basic principles of each media type - text, graphics,
      audio, animation and video - describing their digitization and progressing into issues that arises when media are
      combined; interaction provided by scripting and multimedia distributed over networks.
    p.
      This is conveyed through a number of lectures on the theoretical aspects of the course, each followed by group
      work on exercises related to the topic of the lecture. There will be a series of small mandatory individual
      assignments during the course, as well as a larger group project.

    h2 Individual assignments
    p.
      During the course there will be 5 individual assignments that you will be required to hand in. To hand in an
      assignment you simply send all the required files (will be outlined in the description of the assignment) to me
      at #[a(href="mailto:alexandra.hou@gmail.com") alexandra.hou@gmail.com]. Remember to put your full name in the
      mail, since these assignments will be a part of your final grade.
    p.
      The last hour of each day will focus on these assignments and give you time in class to work, remember this is
      also an opportunity to ask questions while working on the assignment.
    p.
      The overall goal of the individual assignments is to create a business card ready to launch as a website. It is
      therefore a good idea to bear in mind that the 4 first assignments should coexist in the final product.
  section(class="column small-12")
    h2 Group project
    p.
      You must form groups of 3-4 people (there will be time for this on the first day). The project is very open, the
      only requirement is that you combine more than one media into a multimedia project.
    p.
      You will have to make a written description of your project and send to me no later than 10/8-16 12.00 (noon)
      You will also have to present your project to the rest of the class on the 11/8-16.
    p.
      Monday through wednesday of the last week is devoted to making this project. During those days you will work full
      time on your project, my main function will be to answer any question that arises in the process. Since 3 days is
      not a lot of time, I suggest that you during the course discuss ideas in your group, so that when you start
      working on your project, you already have a vision of the project.
  section(class="column small-12")
    h2 Course Evaluation
    p.
      All students will be graded according to the Danish grading scale. The grade will be based on your individual
      assignments (50%) and on your group project including the written description (50%). Attendance during the course
      is mandatory.
